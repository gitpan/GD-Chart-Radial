Revision history for Perl extension GD::Chart::Radial.

0.08    2013-01-13
        - removed Artistic file.
        - change file dates changed to meet W3CDTF standards.
        - updated META files, adding META.json.
        - updated package files.
        - updated test suite.
        - added GitHub repo.
        - added minimum perl version (5.006).
        - reworked Makefile.PL for clarity.

0.07    2007-11-02
        - removed all MD5 tests as they seem to be causing too many problems.

0.06    2007-10-31
        - simplified colour code checks.
        - added tests for colour matching.
        - commented out the debugging as this should only be used as a last 
          resort if things are going wrong.
        - added support for using crosses to disquish data sets.
        - Devel::Cover = 95.8%

0.05    2007-10-31
        - added support for user colours of the format #abcd12 or '#fd3'
        - added examples, more to follow
        - notches now added to filled charts
        - disabled the Linux MD5 check for the image created with defaults, as 
          the different variants of Linux appear to create slightly different 
          files. For OSs without an MD5 check we now print diagnostic info,
          which can be forwarded to me for future releases.
        - realigned the scale values and the top label to better positions.
        - added TODO section in POD.
        - added checks to ensure PNG and JPEG output support is provided.
        - added support for output formats GIF and GD.
        - changed tests to use GD for MD5 checks, as support these is more 
          likely to exist :)

0.04    2007-06-12
        - Minor document changes to complete the handover of maintenance from
          Aaron to Barbie.

0.03    2007-06-10
        - Fixed image size to be either the width and height specified by the
          user, or creates a default size based on the minimum allowed.
        - Scales the graph based on the width and height, rather than always
          being the minimum.
        - Scale fonts according to the size of the graph.
        - Fixed colour list to always be greater than the data sets.
        - Allow user to specify background colour.
        - Legend and Title both optional.
        - Draw spines last if in Fill mode.
        - Cleaned code to only process scale values once.
        - Minor POD updates.
        - Fixed style default back to Notch, as per POD.

0.02    2007-05-31
        - Maintaince now passes to Barbie.
        - More POD
        - width and height passed to new() actually work now!
        - Added the ability to specify style and colours
        - Added more colours (yellow and orange)
        - Made y_max_value and y_tick_number optional, with the defaults 
          being calculated from the data sets themselves
        - Added a 'Fill' style, which allows the datasets to be filled
          polygons rather than a set of lines.
        - Labels were randomly place, now ordered as per the first data set 
          and listed clockwise around the chart points.
        - Repositioned the start point at top dead-centre rather than the 
          furthest point on the X axis.
        - Ensure scale number labels are printed on top of the chart. Note
          that the outer most scale number is omitted due to it conflicting 
          with the point label.
        - more tests
        - Devel::Cover = 95.8%
