Revision history for Perl extension GD::Chart::Radial.

0.04	12/06/2007
	- Minor document changes to complete the handover of maintenance from
	  Aaron to Barbie.

0.03	10/06/2007
	- Fixed image size to be either the width and height specified by the
	  user, or creates a default size based on the minimum allowed.
	- Scales the graph based on the width and height, rather than always
	  being the minimum.
	- Scale fonts according to the size of the graph.
	- Fixed colour list to always be greater than the data sets.
	- Allow user to specify background colour.
	- Legend and Title both optional.
	- Draw spines last if in Fill mode.
	- Cleaned code to only process scale values once.
	- Minor POD updates.
	- Fixed style default back to Notch, as per POD.

0.02	31/05/2007
	- Maintaince now passes to Barbie.
	- More POD
	- width and height passed to new() actually work now!
	- Added the ability to specify style and colours
	- Added more colours (yellow and orange)
	- Made y_max_value and y_tick_number optional, with the defaults 
	  being calculated from the data sets themselves
	- Added a 'Fill' style, which allows the datasets to be filled
	  polygons rather than a set of lines.
	- Labels were randomly place, now ordered as per the first data set 
	  and listed clockwise around the chart points.
	- Repositioned the start point at top dead-centre rather than the 
	  furthest point on the X axis.
	- Ensure scale number labels are printed on top of the chart. Note
	  that the outer most scale number is omitted due to it conflicting 
	  with the point label.
	- more tests
	- Devel::Cover = 95.8%
