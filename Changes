Revision history for Perl extension GD::Chart::Radial.

0.02	31/05/2007
	- Maintaince now passes to Barbie.
	- More POD
	- width and height passed to new() actually work now!
	- Added the ability to specify style and colours
	- Added more colours (yellow and orange)
	- Made y_max_value and y_tick_number optional, with the defaults 
	  being calculated from the data sets themselves
	- Added a 'Fill' style, which allows the datasets to be filled
	  polygons rather than a set of lines.
	- Labels were randomly place, now ordered as per the first data set 
	  and listed clockwise around the chart points.
	- Repositioned the start point at top dead-centre rather than the 
	  furthest point on the X axis.
	- Ensure scale number labels are printed on top of the chart. Note
	  that the outer most scale number is omitted due to it conflicting 
	  with the point label.
	- more tests
	- Devel::Cover = 95.8%
