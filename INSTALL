Installation Instructions

The instructions are basically as per any Perl module.


INSTALLING AUTOMATICALLY
------------------------

The easiest way to install is via CPAN, CPANPLUS or cpanminus:

CPAN:

    % perl -MCPAN -e shell                    [as root]
    > install GD::Chart::Radial
    > quit

CPANPLUS:

    % cpanp
    > i GD::Chart::Radial
    > q

cpanminus:

    % cpanm GD::Chart::Radial

See your local documentation ('perldoc CPAN', 'perldoc CPANPLUS' or 
'perldoc cpanm') for further instructions on setting up and configuring your
chosen installer.


OBTAINING THE MODULE
--------------------

The latest release version of GD-Chart-Radial can be downloaded
from any CPAN site:

    http://search.cpan.org/dist/GD-Chart-Radial/

GD-Chart-Radial is distributed as a gzipped tar archive file:

    GD-Chart-Radial-<version>.tar.gz

where <version> represents the current version number, e.g. 0.01.

To install the module, unpack the distribution archive to
create an installation directory.  Something like this:

    tar zxf GD-Chart-Radial-0.01.tar.gz
or
    gunzip GD-Chart-Radial-0.01.tar.gz
    tar xf GD-Chart-Radial-0.01.tar

You can then 'cd' into the directory created,

    cd GD-Chart-Radial-0.01


INSTALLING MANUALLY
-------------------

The 'make install' (done later) will install the modules and scripts on
your system. You may need administrator privileges to perform this task.
Alternately you can install the module to a local directory (see
ExtUtils::MakeMaker for full details), e.g.

    % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/

Don't forget to update your PERL5LIB environment variable if you do
this, or add a line to your script to tell Perl where to find the files,
e.g.

    use lib qw( /home/me/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0 );

If you're not after a custom location, just do:

    % perl Makefile.PL

If you are lacking any of the prerequisite modules, running that
program will tell you. All prerequisites are available from CPAN.

When you have them all:

    % make && make test

If there are any failures, either post them to the RT site, or email me
directly. It's better to post to the RT site, as then others who may be 
expereincing the same problem can at least add comments or post patches.

When you send your report your trouble, be sure to send the following
information;

    + result of `perl -V'
    + output from 'make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 >& errs'

Send those to bug-GD-Chart-Radial@rt.cpan.org and I'll get back to you as
soon as I'm able.

If it worked, then become root and type:

    # make install

Congratulations. You've just installed GD::Chart::Radial.

If you have a copy of cpantest installed, type:

    % cpantest -g pass -nc -p `basename \`pwd\`` -auto

Or:

    % cpantest -g pass -nc -p GD-Chart-Radial-0.01 -auto

That will tell both me and other potential users that the module
built correctly on your machine.
