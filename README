GD-Chart-Radial
===============

This module aims to provide developers with a quick and easy way to
produce Radial (or Radar if you are an excel spreadsheet user) Charts
using GD and Perl.

This module allows you to plot and output Radial or Radar charts
using the GD library. The module is based on GD::Graph in how it
can be used where possible.

A radial chart has multiple axis spread out from the centre, like
spokes on a wheel. Each axis represents a particular measurement.
Values are plotted by marking the value for what is being measured
on each axis and optionally joining these points. The result can
look like a spiderweb or a radar depending on you plot the
values.
